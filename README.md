# Spotlight Dimmer

## Overview

> Para a versão em português vá para: [LEIAME.md](LEIAME.md)

Spotlight Dimmer is a program for Windows that dims all the monitors other than the monitor that has the currently focused program.

It's intended to help people who use multiple monitores to focus and assist in quickly noticing which window has the current focus while changing focus with shortcuts like `alt + tab`. It's specially useful for users who navigate mainly with the keyboard. It helps to avoid silly situations like typing terminal commands on Teams because you're looking at a screen while the focus is on the other screen.
